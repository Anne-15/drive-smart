# Drive Smart Project
A model built with tensorflow to predict the expected time travel of a delivery system.
The model is built with two different technologies; tensorflow and sktlearn. 

# The tensorflow model
A linear regression problem that tends to solve and predict the expected arrival time in seconds given the distance in kilometers. We used the regression neural networks
algorithm to create a model but first the data ### saved.csv had to be filtered and reduced to 2 columns only (the data that was required). Then the null values eliminated.

# The sktlearn model
The process is basically the similar to the tensorflow model the only difference is that we used a different language, python. 

# Saving the models
After bulding the models from the given algorithms, we saved the models so that we don't have to train the algorithm every time we run the model to save on time and space.
